Hello my name is Ricardo Carvalho, i am a Game Security Specialist, Software Engineer and Security Software Engineer.

I was a very curious kid when came to technology and i have been browsing game hacking forums since 2011/12 which ultimately gave me all the knowledge that i know today.

C/C++ is what i feel more confortable and productive with, i have a little bit of experience with Rust as well. C# is another language that i love working with even tho i am not really a front-end/UI developer, i consider myself a pure low-level engineer. 

On day-to-day basis i am constantly using IDA for reverse engineering and WinDbg/x64dbg/Visual Studio for debugging.

Windows is and will always be my workplace but i have some experience with Linux too like setting up KVMs, and some other general stuff. 

I have worked and am familiar with: git, cross-platform compiling, Docker containers, CI/CD workflows (Github Actions), Windows kernel driver development and debugging, Virtual machines (Hyper-V/VMware), software packing and virtualization (like VMProtect/Themida), data serialization and encryption, and much more things...
